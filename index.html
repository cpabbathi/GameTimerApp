<h2 id="About">About</h2>
<p> Game Timer provides a light-weight, audio-visual interface to a timer you can use while playing games for fun. It is very well suited for games where each team gets a set amount of time. </p>

<p>How is it different from your regular timer, you ask? How about enabling audio for the final countdown in the app. It can be enabled for a few seconds towards the end or for the entire duration. Talk about putting pressure on the team currently playing.</p>

<p>In addition, it has a progress bar which changes color depending on how much time has passed. A quick glance will tell you how far along your round has progressed.</p>

<p>Just prop-up your device where every one can see and your team will not be wasting time checking on the time left in the round.</p>

<p>Also supports dark mode and multi-tasking functionality (split screen and slide-overs) on iPads.</p>
